# Tuples in Python

''' In any programming 'Tuples' cannot be modified
    We can't append in it as well '''

# For Example

tup1 = ("Japan","Korea","India","Sweden","Turkey")
tup2 = tup1

print(tup1)
print(tip2)

# If we assign a new value in tuple that throws an error

tup1[1] = 'Nepal' # Here we're assigning a new value which was assigned previously

print(tup1) # Error: Object doesn't support item assignment
